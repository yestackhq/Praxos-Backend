# bp — FastAPI-boilerplate CLI

`bp` is the developer/operator command-line tool for projects built on the
FastAPI boilerplate. It generates deployment artifacts, helps prepare the
runtime environment, and serves as the host for plugin commands and feature
generators.

## Install

This package is part of the workspace. From the repo root:

```bash
uv sync                    # syncs the workspace; bp is available via `uv run bp`
uv run bp --help
```

To install `bp` machine-wide so it works outside this repo:

```bash
uv tool install --editable ./cli
bp --help
```

## Plugin extension points

Two kinds of plugins, kept deliberately separate:

- `bp.commands` entry-point group — third-party Typer sub-apps mounted under
  `bp <name>` (e.g. `bp aws deploy`).
- `bp.features` entry-point group — code generators with a manifest that
  `bp feature` can list, install, and remove.

See `cli/src/cli/plugins.py` for the discovery contracts.
